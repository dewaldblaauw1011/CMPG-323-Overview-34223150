Instructions of how the reporting works in Power BI:

1. Firstly when you open the powerbi file you will be relocated to 3 pages that consist of: High level-metrics, Device Monitoring and Device Registration
2. Next you can choose which page you want to access first to see the reporting.
3. When the High level-metrics page is chosen you will be able to see the reporting of the devices per category where 0 or more devices are active at the moment. It makes use of a filter on the count of categories to filter it according to more than 0 devices. 
4. If the Device Monitoring page is chosen you will be able to see the devices filtered according to Categories, Status and Zones. This data relates to the excel table provided with data. 
5. Lastly if the Device Registration page is chosen you will be able to see the registration of devices over the timeline till thusfar. You will also be able to see the amount of devices registered and their category. Lastly a timeline report is displayed with all the zones of devices registered and whether they are active or not.
