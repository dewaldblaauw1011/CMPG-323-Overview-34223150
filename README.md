## How .gitignore files will be used with each project.
.gitignore files will be used to ignore the upstream of files to github that will be used. Meaning it doesn't need to be tracked through the repository and can just be ignored. In each repo there will be one .gitignore file that will be created and through that a list of files will be appended to the .gitignore to ensure that those files are ignored and not tracked.  

## How sensitive information and credentials will be protected in the repositories.
With the use of git-secrets wich will statically analyse all commits via  a pre-commit Git Hook. The use of a SECURITY.md file would also be needed with Disclosure Policies, Security Update Policies, Security Related Configuration etc.
