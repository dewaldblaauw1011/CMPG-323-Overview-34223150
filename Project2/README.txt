When launching the solution the followoing will apear on the webpage: 
- Swagger UI with all the RESTful methods needed to retrieve information from the database located in SQL Server and hosted on Azure.
- With these methods different actions can occur e.g : Data retrieval, appendmend and deletion of records. 

I used Swagger to get an Api Framework to ensure methods are done on each controller of the database.

Api token based security and authentication is done and the database can only be accessed with the needed access token provided =  "ByYM000OLlMQG6VVVp1OH7Xzyr7gHuw1qvUC5dcGt3SNM"

Thorough authentication was done with the model itself to ensure privacy and security with JWT Authentication. 

The API is managed and hosted on Azure portal and the link to my Azure solution is : https://connectedoffice2022.azurewebsites.net

The database is migrated and fully integrated with both SQL Server and Azure.
